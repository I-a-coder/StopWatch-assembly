## Working Explanation

The assembly language stopwatch is designed to run in a DOS environment and utilizes hardware interrupts to manage timing and keyboard input. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program operates:

### Key Components

1. **Data Section**:
   - **Variables**: The program defines several variables to keep track of time:
     - `min`: Stores the number of minutes.
     - `sec`: Stores the number of seconds.
     - `csec`: Stores the number of hundredths of a second.
     - `run`: A flag indicating whether the stopwatch is running (1) or stopped (0).
     - `tcount`: A counter used to manage the timing interval.
   - **Messages**: The program includes a message to prompt the user to start the stopwatch.

2. **Timer Interrupt**:
   - The program sets up a timer interrupt (IRQ 0) to trigger every 54.92 milliseconds. This is done by modifying the interrupt vector table to point to the `timer` routine.
   - The `timer` routine increments the `tcount` variable and checks if it has reached a threshold (5 in this case) to update the stopwatch's time.
   - When `tcount` reaches 5, it increments `csec` (hundredths of a second). If `csec` reaches 100, it resets `csec` to 0 and increments `sec` (seconds). If `sec` reaches 60, it resets `sec` to 0 and increments `min` (minutes).

3. **Display Update**:
   - The `update_display` section of the timer interrupt is responsible for updating the display with the current time. It uses DOS interrupts to print the elapsed time in a user-friendly format.
   - The `print_digit` function converts the binary values of minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second into ASCII characters for display.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop of the program waits for keyboard input. It uses DOS interrupt 16h to check for key presses.
   - If the Space key is pressed, the program toggles the `run` flag, starting or stopping the stopwatch.
   - If the Escape key is pressed, the program exits gracefully, restoring the original timer interrupt.

### User Interaction

- When the program starts, it displays a message prompting the user to press the Space key to start or resume the stopwatch and the Escape key to exit.
- The stopwatch runs in the background, updating the display every 54.92 milliseconds while the user can control it with the keyboard.

### Conclusion

This assembly language stopwatch demonstrates the use of hardware interrupts for precise timing and keyboard input handling, providing a simple yet effective way to measure elapsed time in a DOS environment.
