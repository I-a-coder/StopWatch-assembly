# StopWatch-assembly
This project implements a stopwatch in x86 assembly language that starts and stops with the Control key and terminates with the Escape key. The stopwatch is precise to one hundredth of a second, utilizing the timer tick interrupt that occurs every 54.92 milliseconds. The program is designed to run in a DOS environment or DOSBox.
